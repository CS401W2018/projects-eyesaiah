    <p>I served in the <b>Philippines</b> Legazpi Mission from 2021 to 2023 during pandemic. It's a Bicol Region 5, which is the Tagalog language and Bicol langugae that we use. I enjoyed and never regret going on the mission and I learned so much about how to become a better person and being humble at all times. Lastly, I gain a strong testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
