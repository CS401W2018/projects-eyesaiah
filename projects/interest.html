        <h4><p id="firstpar">Martial Arts</p></h4>
        <p class="stormy">- My favorite sports is Taekwondo, because my dad wanted me and my siblings to practice martial arts. which is I do boxing, wrestling, and lastly taekwondo since I was 15 years old. When I started in High School and joining instrams of Taekwondo at the school.</p>

        <h4><p id="firstpar">Billiards</h4>
        <p><p class="forest">- I started to play Billiards with my dad when I was a kid, he teaches me to play the billiards. It is fun to play the billiards because it has different techniques to play the billiards. So I'd learned a lot from my dad by playing billiards but not professional, it makes me feel comfortable and being focused on the cue ball and targeting the other balls whether they are stripes or solid. </p>

        <h4><p id="firstpar">Dance</h4>
        <p><p class="aqua">- When I was in senior high school, my sister taught me how to dance like HIP-HOP dance. Dance makes me feel confident and express of my feelings while I'm dancing, I usually used my free time like early morning dancing on the dance studio. I don't have a dancing style, all I do is enjoy and whatever what kind of dance moves that I want to try well is trying to practice it until I will master it the dance moves.</p>
